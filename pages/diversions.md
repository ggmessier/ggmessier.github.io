# Diversions

It's defintely fair to say that I got into electrical engineering mainly because it would help me have more fun with my hobby projects :)  Here's some assorted information about some of the projects I'm enjoying. Much of this is frog themed due to a long time love of [Kermit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog) and the [role of frogs in our ecosystems](https://www.naturewatch.ca/wp-content/biguploads/senior_guide_712.pdf).
