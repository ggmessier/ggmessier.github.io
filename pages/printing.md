# 3D Printing 

### Overview
- I have a [Prusa](http://prusa3d.com) i3 MK2S printer.  I chose the build your own option to save a bit of money and get to know the printer a bit better.  It was worthwhile and the user comments in the online build manual were invaluable.
- My CAD package of choice is [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/fusion-360/overview) which I use under the non-commerical personal use license.
- The slicer program I use is [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/).

### Printing
1. Once a shape has been created in Fusion, click on the `Activate Component` button (typically at the top of the object hierarchy).
1. Right click on the top of the object hierarchy and select `Save as STL`.   Default options are fine here except that I usually set `Refinement` as `High`.
1. Import the STL file into the slicer program, orient the shape and select the desired print resolution and fill settings.
