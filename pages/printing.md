# 3D Printing 

### Overview
- I have a [Prusa](http://prusa3d.com) i3 MK2S printer.  I chose the build your own option to save a bit of money and get to know the printer a bit better.  It was worthwhile and the user comments in the online build manual were invaluable.
- My CAD package of choice is [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org).
- Like all CAD packages, FreeCAD has a bit of a learning curve.  My go-to resource is this [excellent tutorial](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Basic_Part_Design_Tutorial_017) which covers everything I need to create a basic part.
- The slicer program I use is [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/).

### Printing
** This needs to be updated for FreeCAD.

1. Once a shape has been created in Fusion, click on the `Activate Component` button (typically at the top of the object hierarchy).
1. Right click on the top of the object hierarchy and select `Save as STL`.   Default options are fine here except that I usually set `Refinement` as `High`.
1. Import the STL file into the slicer program, orient the shape and select the desired print resolution and fill settings.
