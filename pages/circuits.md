# Electronics

This page covers various assorted topics related to hardware and electronics design.

## Eagle

I use [eagle](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/eagle/free-download) for my PCB design.  While a little dated, I still like Jeremy Blum's eagle tutorial in parts [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AXwjZoyNno&t=618s), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCTs0mNXY24) and [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oId-h6AeXXE&t=1191s).  It's also handy to be able to know how to create a [custom library part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvRGmltr_P8).
