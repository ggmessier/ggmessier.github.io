# Robot Frogs!

This page discusses how to build frog-themed robots.

## Frog Brain

The "brain" of the frog robots is implemented using a PIC microcontroller from [Microchip](http://microchip.com).  The processors I've selected are from the [PIC16F1777/8/9](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F1779) family since they seem to be the 8 bit PICs that have the most options for interfacing to analog circuitry.

* [Software](frog-pic-sw)

## Tadpole Boards

Aka daughter boards (haha).  These boards plug into the PIC brain board using headers.
