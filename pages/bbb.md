# Beaglebone Black

## Version

It can be a bit tricky to determine which version of the BBB you have.  The BBB [eLinux page](https://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack) and the [schematic](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Dev/Beagle/BBB_SCH_C.pdf) are helpful.



## Beaglebone Black Setup

Images for the BBB can be downloaded from [here](https://beagleboard.org/latest-images) and a description of how to burn the image onto an SD card and then flash the onboard BBB memory with the OS is [here](http://derekmolloy.ie/write-a-new-image-to-the-beaglebone-black/).  **Note**: If you want to burn the eMMC onboard memory with the OS, don't forget to download a "flasher" image rather than the regular ones meant to run natively off of the SD card.
