# Data Analytics Background

- Data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are very hot topics.  [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) has a nice summary of the current state of AI [here](https://youtu.be/NKpuX_yzdYs). 

- **Andrew Ng's Stanford Grad Course:** You can access all of his 2008 Stanford video lectures on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN).  Note that YouTube also has videos shot in 2008 from Ng's grad course that start with [this one](https://youtu.be/UzxYlbK2c7E).  The material in these two lecture series overlap a fair bit but the 2008 lectures are a bit dated.  In particular, they have almost no content on neural networks.  Also useful are the [course notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) from Ng's CS229 graduate course at Stanford.

- **Elements of Statistical Learning:** This is one of the primary textbooks on statistical learning and it can be downloaded for [free](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/).
