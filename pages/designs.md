# Designs

## dAuratus

The dAuratus board is named after [dendrobates auratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_and_black_poison_dart_frog) (aka the green and black poison dart frog) which is currently acknowledged to be the smartest of all frogs.  This is a custom designed PCB hosting the [AVR128DB28](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR128DB28) device that I use for home hobby projects.


## Lithobot

Named after the Northern Leopard frog, [lithobates pipiens](https://www.ab-conservation.com/avamp/identification-keys/juvenile-and-adult-amphibians-of-alberta/northern-leopard-frog/); a frog that can help keep gardens healthy by eating pests and is currently [threatened in Alberta](https://naturealberta.ca/what-happened-to-the-northern-leopard-frog/).

Implemented using a dAuratus board with the following functionality:
- Soil moisture sensor(s).
- Photocell sunlight sensor.
- Temperature sensor.
- eRibbit wireless link.


## bbBufo

The central bbb interface to the home network.  Named after Bufo marinus, the largest known species of toad.


## eRibbit

A wireless protocol built on top of LoRa.
