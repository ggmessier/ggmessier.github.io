# AVR Micro-Controllers (MCUs)

The AVR MCU family are my devices of choice for simple computing.  I also use the AVR devices as my example micro-architecture in the intro to computer architecture class I teach at the University of Calgary.  You can view all the lectures on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9lbQ5Kkad4yI338WcdQ1SQ).
