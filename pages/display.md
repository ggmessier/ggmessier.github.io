# Displays

Currently using the SSD1306 Adafruit OLED display which has some [excellent documentation and support](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/downloads).  Since I'm rolling my own code in C, I don't directly use the existing Arduino Adafruit libraries but I'm adapting a lot of their library code and learning a bunch from it.
