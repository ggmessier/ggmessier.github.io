# Data Analytics

*Itâ€™s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.*
-Yogi Berra

*There are two kinds of forecasters: those who don't know, and those who don't know they don't know.*
-John Kenneth Galbraith

In general, the purpose of my data analytics program is to improve the services provided to individuals living with homelessness, addiction and mental health concerns.   As I publish work in this area, I also release the source code used to generate the published results in my data analytics [github repository](https://github.com/ggmessier/data-analytics).  I also use it as a platform to share open source code under the [GNU General Public License, Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).  The purpose of sharing our code is to provide the details regarding how we generate our research results and to allow the not-for-profit homelessness serving sector to utilize our work.  Finally,   So, it also helps in the job hunt.

Advice to New Students: There is a *lot* of information here.  Do not try to learn absolutely everything at first.  Start by spending a day scanning these resources, spending a day becoming generally familiar with the content and then start working on the tasks set out in the Exercises sections.  These exercises are meant to focus you on the main skills you'll need to start your research.  You can then re-visit the resources on this page as you encounter specific problems that require a particular tool.
