# Data Analytics

*Itâ€™s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.*

-Yogi Berra

The primary purpose of my data analytics program is to improve the services provided to individuals living with homelessness.  As I publish work in this area, I also release the source code used to generate the published results in my data analytics [github repository](https://github.com/ggmessier/data-analytics).


### Background Material


Data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are very hot topics.  [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) has a nice summary of the current state of AI [here](https://youtu.be/NKpuX_yzdYs).  The purpose of these pages is to document some of the practicalities of implementing machine learning as I work through them as part of my research.
