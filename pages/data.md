# Data Analytics

*Itâ€™s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.*

-Yogi Berra

Data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are very hot topics.  [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) has a nice summary of the current state of AI [here](https://youtu.be/NKpuX_yzdYs).  The purpose of these pages is to document some of the practicalities of implementing machine learning as I work through them as part of my research.
