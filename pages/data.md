# Data Analytics

*Itâ€™s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.*

-Yogi Berra

The primary purpose of my data analytics program is to improve the services provided to individuals living with homelessness.  As I publish work in this area, I also release the source code used to generate the published results in my data analytics [github repository](https://github.com/ggmessier/data-analytics).
