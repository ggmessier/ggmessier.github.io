# Data Analytics

*Itâ€™s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.*
-Yogi Berra

*There are two kinds of forecasters: those who don't know, and those who don't know they don't know.*
-John Kenneth Galbraith

In general, the purpose of my data analytics program is to improve the services provided to individuals living with homelessness, addiction and mental health concerns.  The purpose of these pages is to provide more information about our methods and provide resources for new students and anyone interested in learning more about data analytics and machine learning.

**Advice to New Students:** There is a *lot* of information here.  Do not try to learn absolutely everything at first.  Start by spending a day scanning these resources and spend about a day becoming generally familiar with the content.  These exercises are meant to focus you on the main skills you'll need to start your research.  You can then re-visit the resources on this page as you encounter specific problems that require a particular tool.
