His [orientation course](https://nickfalvo.ca/courses/) and [open textbook](https://nickfalvo.ca/book/) are excellent resources for learning more about vulnerable populations and homelessness.  He also posts a ton of content on Twitter and is very [worth following](https://twitter.com/nicholas_falvo).
