The first goal of my research program is to remove the barriers for using wireless networks in industrial facilities.  The second goal is to provide an environment where research students are able to develop their academic, technical and professional skills.


### Technical Research Program

My first area of interest is understanding how the physical environment affects communication propagation.  My group has conducted over 9 different field experiments to collect wired and wireless signal propagation channel measurements.  Analysis of these measurements leads to new statistical models for how communications signals behave.

My second area of research is utilizing propagation measurements to improve the design of communications systems.  As our propagation measurement research reveals new information about how communication signals are distorted in the channel, it is necessary to modify the design of the communications transmitter and receiver to compensate for these impairments.  This leads to new physical layer research involving modulation, signal detection, coding and channel estimation.

My final area of interest is the design of wireless networks for industrial environments.    This work falls into the area of cyber-physical systems and involves finding the best ways to control physical systems over data networks.  While this research is applicable to any industrial setting, my focus is primarily on petroleum facilities due to the importance of the energy industry to Alberta and Canada.  Specifically, we are exploring new high reliability and low latency networking techniques that will ensure the stability of the industrial process control algorithms running over the network.

### Student Experience
It is my goal to provide all of my research students with the opportunity to grow by developing their own innovative solutions to important research problems.  The structure of my program is intended not only to develop technical research skills but also communications, teamwork and hands-on experimental skills.

I would like all of my research students to have a hands on experimental experience.  To support this activity, my research lab is equipped with state of the art software radio platforms and a full set of 2.4~GHz band wireless test equipment, including oscilloscopes, a network analyzer, a spectrum analyzer, signal sources and a logic analyzer. 

It is critical that any researcher is not only able to develop innovative ideas but to also communicate those ideas clearly and succinctly.  I run workshops with my research team to train them in effective presentation skills and written communication.  Presentation skills are refined through practice presentations within our group and external presentations at conferences and to industry sponsors. The effective writing training deals with establishing a message for a document and then using proper figure design and paragraph structure to ensure that message is clearly communicated to a busy reader.

The majority of students with engineering graduate degrees find employment in industry where they must be able to work in teams in order to make a contribution.  My emphasis on experimentation means that each student must use the same software radio platform and lab test equipment to implement basic functionality in his/her experimental platform.

It is here where my students work in teams.  One area of collaboration is the software used to program basic software radio functionality.  Rather than requiring each student to develop this code from scratch, my lab has a code tree where multiple students make contributions, often in parallel.  To manage this code development, we utilize the same code development and revision control tools used in industry.  My lab also utilizes an online wiki documentation system for sharing information ranging from effective presentation tips to software radio architecture.

### Interested in joining us?
I am always interested in reviewing applications from well qualified students interesting in joining my research team.  If you are interested in applying to be a member of my group,  please include the following information in your email:

  * A complete CV summarizing both your academic and work experience.
  * A scanned version of your transcripts.
  * A one page letter explaining which of the research areas I have listed above that most interest you and why you feel you are a good candidate to work in your area of interest.  The more specific you can be, the better your chances.
  * An indication of whether you already have financial support or if you will require funding from the University of Calgary.

I tend not to consider “form letters” or generic emails sent to a large number of recipients.  I will consider your application only if it is clear you have followed these instructions and have made an effort to put together an application that is specifically for me.

Also please note that I receive a very large number of emails from candidates interested in studying in my research group.  This makes it impractical for me to respond to all the emails I receive.  However, I do read all of the applications that are sent to me and I will contact you if I have an open position that you appear qualified for.
