The first goal of my research program is to remove the barriers for using wireless networks in industrial facilities.  The second goal is to provide an environment where research students are able to develop their academic, technical and professional skills.


### Technical Research Program

My research area is the design of digital communications networks for industrial applications.  This work involves:
 + Wired and wireless network protocol design and optimization.
 + The exploration of cyber-physical systems and how network behavior affects the quality of services using that network.
 + The application of machine learning techniques to real world industrial data in order to determine how network design needs to evolve to accomodate changes in network application traffic and utilization.

### Open Positions

I am currently interviewing candidates for a funded PhD position in my research group.  The start date for this position is September 2019.  This candidate will be conducting research on applying machine learning and data mining techniques to Alberta petroleum production data and then utilizing the results to design the best network for monitoring and controlling that petroleum production.  A background in artifician intelligence, machine learning, network design and software development is an asset.

If you are interested in applying for this position, please see the *Interested in joining us?* section below with details regarding how to proceed.

### Student Experience
It is my goal to provide all of my research students with the opportunity to grow by developing their own innovative solutions to important research problems.  The structure of my program is intended not only to develop technical research skills but also communications, teamwork and hands-on experimental skills.

I would like all of my research students to have a hands on experimental experience.  To support this activity, my research lab is equipped with state of the art software radio platforms and a full set of 2.4~GHz band wireless test equipment, including oscilloscopes, a network analyzer, a spectrum analyzer, signal sources and a logic analyzer. 

It is critical that any researcher is not only able to develop innovative ideas but to also communicate those ideas clearly and succinctly.  I run workshops with my research team to train them in effective presentation skills and written communication.  Presentation skills are refined through practice presentations within our group and external presentations at conferences and to industry sponsors. The effective writing training deals with establishing a message for a document and then using proper figure design and paragraph structure to ensure that message is clearly communicated to a busy reader.

The majority of students with engineering graduate degrees find employment in industry where they must be able to work in teams in order to make a contribution.  My emphasis on experimentation means that each student must use the same software radio platform and lab test equipment to implement basic functionality in his/her experimental platform.

It is here where my students work in teams.  One area of collaboration is the software used to program basic software radio functionality.  Rather than requiring each student to develop this code from scratch, my lab has a code tree where multiple students make contributions, often in parallel.  To manage this code development, we utilize the same code development and revision control tools used in industry.  My lab also utilizes an online wiki documentation system for sharing information ranging from effective presentation tips to software radio architecture.

### Interested in joining us?
I am always interested in reviewing applications from well qualified students interesting in joining my research team.  If you are interested in applying to be a member of my group,  please include the following information in your email:

  * A complete CV summarizing both your academic and work experience.
  * A scanned version of your transcripts.
  * A one page letter explaining why you feel you are a good fit for an opening in my group.  The more specific you can be, the better your chances.
  * An indication of whether you already have financial support or if you will require funding from the University of Calgary.

I tend not to consider “form letters” or generic emails sent to a large number of recipients.  I will consider your application only if it is clear you have followed these instructions and have made an effort to put together an application that is specifically for me.

Also please note that I receive a very large number of emails from candidates interested in studying in my research group.  This makes it impractical for me to respond to all the emails I receive.  However, I do read all of the applications that are sent to me and I will contact you if I have an open position that you appear qualified for.
