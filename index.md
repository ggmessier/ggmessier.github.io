I'm a Professor in [Electrical and Software Engineering](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/electrical-software) in the [Schulich School of Engineering](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/) at the [University of Calgary](https://ucalgary.ca/), Canada.  This site describes my research and teaching at the university as well as any other fun [side projects](pages/diversions) I'm interested in.  You can check out a bit more on my background [here](pages/background).

## Research

My research involves using data science to improve the services provided to people experiencing homelessness, mental health disorders and addiction.  This ranges from developing algorithms to help spot folks who need help to creating data visualization tools for staff working directly with vulnerable groups.

We work in cross-disciplinary teams that include researchers and clinicians from psychiatry, medicine and social work.  We are also proud to collaborate with some of the amazing community agencies that provide support to this very vulnerable group.  These agencies include [The Calgary Drop-In Centre](https://calgarydropin.ca/), the [Calgary Homeless Foundation](https://www.calgaryhomeless.com/) and [Trellis](https://www.growwithtrellis.ca/).

Data science and machine learning can be used in a variety of ways and it is important to emphasize that we are not developing algorithms that automate support and/or treatment decisions.  Instead, our goal is to develop tools that provide information to support the human staff doing front line work with vulnerable individuals.
