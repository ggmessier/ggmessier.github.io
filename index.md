## Teaching

I enjoy using a variety of teaching methods including the "flipped classroom" approach where my lectures are on video and we use class time for discussion and problem solving.  You can view the video lectures for my graduate courses on digital communications, wireless communications and probability on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9lbQ5Kkad4yI338WcdQ1SQ).
